gabelstaplerfahrer
==================

Node.js release and deployment tool

Aim of gabelstaplerfahrer is to provide developer with convenient way to
create packages from their node.js application and deploy them on their
favourite linux distribution. In future I have plans to implement deploy to
cloud services as openshift,heroku and others.
